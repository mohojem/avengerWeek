               <h2>Fun facts about Hawkeye</h2>
               <h3>🏹 Hawkeye (Clint Barton)</h3>
              <p><b>Created by:</b> Stan Lee and Don Heck</p>
               <p><b>First Appearance:</b> Tales of Suspense #57 (1964)</p>
                  <p><b>Strengths:</b>  Master archer, tactician, skilled in combat and acrobatics.</p>
                 <p><b>Weaknesses:</b>  Human limitations, poor impulse control in early comics.</p>
             <p><b>Overlooked Fact:</b> He was deaf in the comics for a long time—a fact reintroduced in the Disney+ series.</p>
                 <p><b>Inspiration:</b> Robin Hood-style vigilante, originally mistaken for a villain.</p>
                  <br/>
                  <h3>He Was Deaf for a Huge Chunk of His History</h3>
               <p>In the comics, Clint lost most of his hearing early on (in Hawkeye Vol. 1 #4, 1983).</p>
               <p>It happened when he used a sonic arrow to stop a villain—intentionally deafening himself.</p>
               <p>He wore hearing aids for decades in the comics.</p>
               <p>In later runs like Matt Fraction’s 2012 Hawkeye, this deafness was revisited and became central to his identity.</p>
               <h4>👉 Hawkeye is one of the few disabled heroes who doesn't have a “superpower workaround.</h4>
                    <br/>
                  <h3>He Was a Villain First</h3>
                  <p>He was manipulated by Black Widow (then a Russian spy) into fighting Iron Man.</p>
                  <p>After realizing his mistake, he switched sides and joined the Avengers.</p>
                  <h4>📌 This puts Clint in the unique position of being an Avenger who chose redemption rather than being recruited or born heroic.</h4>
