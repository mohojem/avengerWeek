               <h2>Fun facts about Thor</h2>
               <h3>ðŸ”¨ Thor (Thor Odinson)</h3>
               <p><b>Created by:</b> Stan Lee (concept), Larry Lieber (writer), Jack Kirby (art)</p>
               <p><b>First Appearance:</b> Journey into Mystery #83 (1962)</p>
                  <p><b>Strengths:</b> god of Thunder, Mjolnir grants flight/weather control, virtually immortal.</p>
                 <p><b>Weaknesses:</b> Arrogance, vulnerability to magic, emotionally naive.</p>
             <p><b>Overlooked Fact:</b> Early Thor comics leaned heavily on Shakespearean speech and Norse mythology.</p>
                 <p><b>Inspiration:</b> Norse mythsâ€”Marvel adapted existing deities, a rare move at the time.</p>
                  <br/>
               <h3>He Speaks Like Shakespeare On Purpose</h3>
               <h4>Thorâ€™s early dialogue is famously formal and "ye olde."</h4>
               <p>This wasnâ€™t just a quirk; it was a deliberate choice by Stan Lee to make Thor feel ancient, noble, and otherworldly compared to the New York slang of heroes like Spider-Man.</p>
               <p>It gave Thor gravitas but also made him harder to relate to for some readers.</p>
