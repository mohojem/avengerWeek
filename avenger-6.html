               <h2>Fun facts about Black Widow</h2>
               <h3>🕷️ Black Widow (Natasha Romanoff)</h3>
                <p><b>Created by:</b> Stan Lee and Don Heck</p>
               <p><b>First Appearance:</b> Tales of Suspense #57 (1964)</p>
                  <p><b>Strengths:</b>  Master archer, tactician, skilled in combat and acrobatics.</p>
                 <p><b>Weaknesses:</b>  Human limitations, poor impulse control in early comics.</p>
             <p><b>Overlooked Fact:</b> He was deaf in the comics for a long time—a fact reintroduced in the Disney+ series.</p>
                 <p><b>Inspiration:</b> Robin Hood-style vigilante, originally mistaken for a villain.</p>
                  <br/>
                  <h3>She Was Trained to Be a Ballerina—As a Cover for an Assassin</h3>
               <p>Natasha's ballerina background wasn't just for grace—it was part of the Red Room’s psychological conditioning.</p>
               <p>Her ballet training hid her combat skills, enhanced her agility, and conditioned her to endure pain silently.</p>
               <h4>💃 Her grace is weaponized—a chilling reflection of how deeply she was manipulated from childhood.</h4>
                    <br/>
                  <h3> She Was Brainwashed Multiple Times</h3>
                  <p>The Red Room erased her memories, planted fake ones (like a fake husband and child), and even rewrote her loyalties.</p>
                  <p>She had to reclaim her identity piece by piece, often unsure what parts of her life were real.</p>
                     <br/>
                  <h3>Black Widow isn’t a sidekick—she’s a survivor.</h3>
                  <p>Was born into control and cruelty</p>
                  <p>Fought her way out of the shadows</p>
                  <p>Became the moral backbone of the Avengers without asking for praise.</p>
                  <h4>She proves that being human is not a weakness—it’s a superpower of its own.</h4>
