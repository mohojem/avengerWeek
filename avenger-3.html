               <h2>Fun facts about Hulk</h2>
               <h3>ðŸŸ© Hulk (Bruce Banner)</h3>
               <p><b>Created by:</b> Stan Lee and Jack Kirby</p>
               <p><b>First Appearance:</b> The Incredible Hulk #1 (1962)</p>
                  <p><b>Strengths:</b>  Limitless strength, rapid healing, resistance to most damage.</p>
                 <p><b>Weaknesses:</b>  Emotional instability, dual personality disorder.</p>
             <p><b>Overlooked Fact:</b> Hulk was originally grey; green came later due to printing issues.</p>
                 <p><b>Inspiration:</b> Dr. Jekyll & Mr. Hyde + Frankenstein</p>

                  <h3>ðŸ§ª Hulk Was Supposed to Be Grey, Not Green</h3>
               <h4>Why Grey?</h4>
               <p>Stan Lee wanted Hulk to feel like a monster caught between black-and-white moralityâ€”not good, not evil.</p>
               <p>Grey was symbolic of that ambiguity: not black, not white.</p>
               <p>It also drew inspiration from Frankensteinâ€™s monster, classic horror films, and even a bit of Dr. Jekyll & Mr. Hyde.</p>
                   <br/>
                  <h3>ðŸ’¥ What Went Wrong?</h3>
                  <p>The printers at the time had technical issues reproducing the grey ink consistently.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes Hulk came out too light or almost black depending on the page.</p>
                  <p>So by issue #2, they made him green insteadâ€”purely because it was easier to print and stood out.</p>
