        <h4>Think you know the Avengers?</h4>
        <h5>Think again.</h5>
          <p>Sure, they’re Earth’s Mightiest Heroes—but they’re also a walking circus of chaos, accidents, and secret history. The Hulk? He was supposed to be grey, but a printing error turned him green. Captain America once turned into a werewolf (yes, Capwolf is real). Thor? He got magically turned into a frog and still wielded Mjolnir with amphibian glory. Iron Man, Marvel’s tech genius, had a cassette player in his chest in early comics—because what’s more heroic than rewinding yourself? Black Widow used to be married to a Soviet supervillain, Hawkeye started out as a criminal, and the team’s very first villain was…the Hulk himself. Even their origin story is petty: Stan Lee only created them because DC’s Justice League was crushing sales. Over the years, the Avengers have had over 100 rotating members—including Blade, Hercules, and even Dracula. Behind the glamor, they’re more dysfunctional family than flawless team—betraying each other, falling apart, and sometimes accidentally creating their worst enemies. They're messy, unpredictable, and endlessly fascinating—which is exactly why we can’t stop watching them save (and sometimes accidentally endanger) the world.</p>
