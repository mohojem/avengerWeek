               <h2>Fun facts about Captain America</h2>
               <h3>🧬 Captain America (Steve Rogers)</h3>
                <p><b>Created by:</b> Joe Simon and Jack Kirby</p>
               <p><b>First Appearance:</b> Captain America Comics #1 (1941)</p>
                  <p><b>Strengths:</b>  Super-soldier serum grants peak human abilities, unshakable will, leadership.</p>
                 <p><b>Weaknesses:</b>  Out-of-time mindset, struggles with modern ideologies.</p>
             <p><b>Overlooked Fact:</b> Cap was punching Hitler before the U.S. even entered WWII—very political for its time</p>
                 <p><b>Inspiration:</b>  American patriotism and WWII propaganda hero.</p>
                  <br/>
                  <h3> American patriotism and WWII propaganda hero.</h3>
               <p>His first comic cover shows him punching Hitler in the face—months before Pearl Harbor.</p>
               <p>Created by Joe Simon and Jack Kirby, both Jewish Americans, Cap was a bold anti-fascist icon, not just a superhero.</p>
                  <br/>
               <h3>He’s Been “Frozen” More Than Once</h3>
               <h4>Most people think Steve was frozen in ice once and revived in the modern day.Actually:</h4>
               <p>He’s been frozen, re-frozen, sent through time loops, and trapped in alternate dimensions in multiple arcs</p>
               <p>Sometimes he returns older, sometimes still young—depending on how he’s preserved or resurrected.</p>
               <p>🧊 His displacement isn’t just a plot device—it represents how he's always out of sync with the world around him.</p>
                    <br/>
                  <h3>He Was Rejected by the Military Before Becoming Cap</h3>
                  <p>Steve wasn’t just physically weak; he had asthma, anemia, and other medical issues.</p>
                  <p>He was rejected from service multiple times, but persisted out of sheer will.</p>
                  <p>What made him worthy of the Super Soldier Serum wasn’t strength—but his unshakable moral compass.</p>
